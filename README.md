HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the web. It is the foundation of most web pages, providing the basic structure that is enhanced and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive with JavaScript.
<h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h4>

CSS is used to style the HTML elements. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of the web UI. CSS can also be used to make the UI responsive, ensuring it looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

<h4>JavaScript:</h4>
JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the Web UI. It allows for dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and handling user events like clicks, hovers, and keypresses. JavaScript can also be used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), which represents the HTML structure of the web page.
